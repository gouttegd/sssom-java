/**
 * A class to transform mapping metadata slots into into their mapped IRIs
 * according to the SSSOM specification.
 * <p>
 * This class differs from the {@link DirectMetadataTransformer} class in that
 * it takes into account the value of the <code>slot_uri</code> field for the
 * slot in the SSSOM schema, if the slot has such a field. For example, when
 * applied to the <code>creator_id</code> slot, this class will return the IRI
 * for <code>dcterms:creator</code>, instead of <code>sssom:creator_id</code>.
