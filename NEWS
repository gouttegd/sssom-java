Changes in sssom-java 0.2.0
---------------------------

    * Report all undeclared prefixes once parsing is over, instead of
      erroring out on the first undeclared prefix.
    * Support inversion of mappings.
    * Support filtering on many more fields.
    * New options for the sssom-inject ROBOT command:
      * --dispatch-table, to write generated axioms to different files;
      * --include-rule, to selectively enable only some rules;
      * --exclude-rule, to selectively disable some rules;
      * --direct, to generate direct OWL serialisation of mappings.
