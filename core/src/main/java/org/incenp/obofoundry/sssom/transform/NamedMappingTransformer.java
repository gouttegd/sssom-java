/**
 * A mapping transformer that has a string representation. This class merely
 * wraps an existing transformer. It is mostly intended for debugging, so that
 * transformers created using lambda functions can still be displayed in a
 * readable form.
 * <p>
 * Example, for a transformer that produces basic string representations of
 * mappings:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * IMappingTransformer&lt;String&gt; myTransformer = new NamedMappingTransformer&lt;String&gt;("mapping-to-string",
 *         (mapping) -&gt; String.format("%s -[%s]-&gt; %s", mapping.getSubjectId(), mapping.getPredicateId(),
 *                 mapping.getObjectId()));
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of object to transform the mapping into.
