/**
 * A YAML preprocessor to convert a dictionary containing a
 * {@code match_term_type} metadata slot into its standardised equivalents.
 * <p>
 * Initial versions of the SSSOM specification described a
 * {@code match_term_type} metadata slot which accepted values from a specific
 * enumeration and was intended to describe what was being matched (e.g., it
 * indicated that a given mapping was between two OWL classes, or between two
 * SKOS concepts, etc.). In SSSOM 0.9.1, this slot was replaced by two distinct
 * slots called {@code subject_type} and {@code object_type}.
