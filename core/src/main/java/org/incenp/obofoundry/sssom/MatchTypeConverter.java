/**
 * A YAML preprocessor to convert a dictionary containing a {@code match_type}
 * metadata slot into its standardised equivalent.
 * <p>
 * Initial versions of the SSSOM specification described a {@code match_type}
 * metadata slot which accepted values from a specific enumeration. In SSSOM
 * 0.9.1, this slot was replaced by a new {@code mapping_justification} slot
 * which accepts entity references, and the enumeration was replaced by terms
 * from the SEMAPV vocabulary.
