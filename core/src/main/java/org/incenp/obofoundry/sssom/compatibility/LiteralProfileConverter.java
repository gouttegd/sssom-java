/**
 * A YAML preprocessor to convert <code>literal*</code> slots.
 * <p>
 * For a time, the SSSOM specification half-defined a "literal profile",
 * intended for mappings between a literal and an entity. That profile has
 * several literal-specific slots. In SSSOM 1.0, this profile has been removed
 * and replaced by a convention that literal subjects are represented by storing
 * the literal in the <code>subject_label</code> slot and setting the
 * <code>subject_type</code> slot to <code>rdfs literal</code>.
